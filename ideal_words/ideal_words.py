class FactorEmbedding:
    """
    Utility class that encapsulates the some additional logic needed to compute ideal words and scores. That is, how to
    compute text embeddings (e.g, a tokenizer and a text encoder), how to jointly represent a tuple (z_1, ..., z_k) as a
    string, and how to represent a single z_i as a string.

    By default, text is embedded using the given tokenizer and the forward method of the given text encoder, a tuple z
    is represented as a string by joining tuple elements with spaces, and a single zi is its own string representation.
    If you want to customize this behaviour, sub-type this class.
